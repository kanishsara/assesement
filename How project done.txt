11.After creating everything, right click the project and convert to TestNG. Testng.xml is created. Then running the Test as TestNG.

[I added 3 set of datas in excel for login information. First two datas are wrong and third one is right.So result will be 
      Failure:2, Sucess:1, Skip:0]

In the trello only 10 boards can be created freely. I already used 4 to 5 boards while doing and checking automation before sending to you. So only remaining number of boards can be created with this login details.After that we can create new board. We can use another account.for that just excel information about login only can be changed.
